## Basic Ruby Syntax

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. In this section, we'll cover the basic syntax of Ruby to help you get started.

### 1. Comments
In Ruby, you can add comments using the # symbol. Comments are ignored by the Ruby interpreter and are useful for documenting your code.

```ruby
# This is a single-line comment

=begin
This is a
multi-line comment
=end
```

### 2. Output
You can display output in Ruby using the puts (put string) or print methods.

```ruby
puts "Hello, Ruby!" # Prints with a newline
print "Hello, Ruby!" # Prints without a newline
```

### 3. Variables and Data Types
Ruby is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly.

```ruby
name = "John" # String
age = 30 # Integer
height = 6.2 # Float
is_student = true # Boolean
```

### 4. Strings
Ruby supports single-quoted (') and double-quoted (") strings. Double-quoted strings allow for string interpolation.

```ruby
single_quoted = 'This is a single-quoted string.'
double_quoted = "Hello, #{name}!" # String interpolation
```

### 5. Numbers
Ruby supports integers and floating-point numbers.

```ruby
integer_number = 42
float_number = 3.14
```

### 6. Arrays
Arrays are ordered collections of elements, and they can contain different data types.

```ruby
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

### 7. Hashes
Hashes, also known as dictionaries or associative arrays, store key-value pairs.

```ruby
person = {
  "name" => "John",
  "age" => 30,
}
```

### 8. Control Structures
Ruby provides common control structures like if, else, elsif, unless, case, and loops (while, until, for, each).

```ruby
if age >= 18
  puts "You are an adult."
else
  puts "You are a minor."
end
```

### 9. Functions (Methods)
You can define functions using the def keyword. Ruby functions return the result of the last executed statement.

```ruby
def greet(name)
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end

puts greet("Alice") # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```
### 10. Symbols
Symbols are lightweight strings often used as keys in hashes.

```ruby
:my_symbol
```

### 11. Classes and Objects
Ruby is an object-oriented language, and you can define classes and create objects.

```js
class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def say_hello
    "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end
end

john = Person.new("John")
puts john.say_hello # Outputs: Hello, John!
```

### 12. Exception Handling
Ruby uses begin, rescue, and end for exception handling.

```ruby
begin
  result = 10 / 0
rescue ZeroDivisionError
  puts "Error: Division by zero!"
end
```

### 13. Symbols and Blocks
Symbols are often used in Ruby for efficiency, and blocks are used for defining anonymous functions.

```ruby
# Symbol
:my_symbol

# Block
[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
  puts number
end
```

## Ruby Functions

n Ruby, functions are known as methods, and they play a crucial role in organizing and encapsulating code. In this section, we'll cover the basic syntax of Ruby methods, including how to define them, work with arguments, return values, and use procs and blocks.

### 1. Defining Methods
In Ruby, you define methods using the def keyword, followed by the method name, parentheses for arguments (if any), and an end to signify the method's body.

```ruby
def greet(name)
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end
```

### 2. Calling Methods
To call a method, use its name followed by parentheses containing the arguments (if any).

```ruby
result = greet("Alice")
puts result # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

### 3. Method Arguments
Ruby methods can take zero or more arguments. You can define methods with required, optional, or default arguments.

```ruby
def add(x, y)
  x + y
end

puts add(2, 3) # Outputs: 5
```
#### Optional Arguments
```ruby
def greet(name, greeting = "Hello")
  "#{greeting}, #{name}!"
end

puts greet("Bob") # Outputs: Hello, Bob!
puts greet("Alice", "Hi") # Outputs: Hi, Alice!
```
#### Default Arguments
```ruby
def divide(x, y = 1)
  x / y
end

puts divide(6) # Outputs: 6
puts divide(6, 2) # Outputs: 3
```
### 4. Return Values
Ruby methods return the result of the last executed statement by default. However, you can use the return keyword to explicitly return a value.

```ruby
def add(x, y)
  result = x + y
  return result
end

sum = add(2, 3)
puts sum # Outputs: 5
```

### 5. Procs
A proc is an object that holds a block of code. You can create a proc using the Proc.new or -> syntax. Procs can be stored in variables and passed as arguments to methods.

```ruby
my_proc = Proc.new { |x| x * 2 }
puts my_proc.call(3) # Outputs: 6
```

### 6. Blocks
Blocks are chunks of code enclosed within do...end or curly braces {...}. They are often used with methods that yield control to the block.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
  puts number
end
```

You can define methods that accept blocks using the yield keyword:

```ruby
def say_hello
  puts "Hello!"
  yield if block_given?
end

say_hello do
  puts "Block executed."
end

# Outputs:
# Hello!
# Block executed.
```
In Ruby, blocks are commonly used for iterators, custom control structures, and working with collections like arrays and hashes.

Understanding Ruby's method syntax, argument handling, return values, procs, and blocks is essential for effective Ruby programming. These features make Ruby a versatile language, especially when used in conjunction with libraries and frameworks like Ruby on Rails.

## Ruby Classes

Classes are fundamental in Ruby for creating objects and organizing code. In this section, we'll cover the basic syntax of Ruby classes, including constructors, properties (attributes), methods, inheritance, overriding methods, and the concept of static methods and properties.

### 1. Basic Syntax
To define a class in Ruby, you use the class keyword, followed by the class name in CamelCase. The class's code block contains its properties and methods.

```ruby
class Person
  # Properties and methods go here
end
```
### 2. Constructors
In Ruby, the constructor method is named initialize. It's automatically called when an instance of the class is created using new.

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

person = Person.new("Alice", 30)
```

### 3. Properties, Getters, and Setters
Properties in Ruby are instance variables, typically prefixed with @. To access them, you can create getter and setter methods.

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # Getter method
  def name
    @name
  end

  # Setter method
  def name=(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end
end

person = Person.new("Alice")
puts person.name # Outputs: Alice
person.name = "Bob"
puts person.name # Outputs: Bob
```

You can also use Ruby's built-in attr_reader, attr_writer, or attr_accessor to generate getter and setter methods automatically.

```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader :name
  attr_writer :name
  # or attr_accessor :name for both getter and setter
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
```

### 4. Methods
Methods in Ruby are defined within the class block. You can call them on instances of the class.

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end
end

person = Person.new("Alice")
puts person.greet # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```
### 5. Inheritance
Ruby supports single inheritance, allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. Use the < symbol to indicate inheritance.

```ruby
class Student < Person
  def initialize(name, school)
    super(name)
    @school = school
  end
end

student = Student.new("Bob", "High School")
puts student.greet # Outputs: Hello, Bob!
```

### 6. Overriding Methods
Inherited methods can be overridden by defining a method with the same name in the child class. To call the parent class's method, use the super keyword.

```ruby
class Student < Person
  def greet
    "Hi, I'm a student named #{@name}!"
  end
end

student = Student.new("Charlie", "College")
puts student.greet # Outputs: Hi, I'm a student named Charlie!
```

### 7. Static Methods and Properties
In Ruby, class methods are defined using the self keyword within the class. They are called on the class itself, not on instances.

```ruby
class MathUtils
  def self.square(x)
    x * x
  end
end

result = MathUtils.square(5)
puts result # Outputs: 25
```

Class variables are shared across all instances of a class. They are prefixed with @@.

```ruby
class Counter
  @@count = 0

  def initialize
    @@count += 1
  end

  def self.total_count
    @@count
  end
end

Counter.new
Counter.new
puts Counter.total_count # Outputs: 2
```
Understanding classes, constructors, properties, methods, inheritance, method overriding, and class-level methods and properties is essential for building robust and organized Ruby applications. Classes are at the core of object-oriented programming in Ruby, allowing you to create reusable and modular code.

## Ruby CLI

### Running Ruby Scripts
To run Ruby scripts from the command line, use the ruby command followed by the script's filename. For example:

```shell
ruby my_script.rb
```

You can also run one-liner Ruby code directly from the command line using the -e option:

```shell
ruby -e 'puts "Hello, World!"'
```
### Commands for Working with Gems and Gemfiles
#### 1. Installing Gems
To install a Ruby gem, use the gem install command followed by the gem's name:

```shell
gem install gem_name
```
#### 2. Listing Installed Gems
You can list all the installed gems using:

```shell
gem list
```

#### 3. Running a Ruby Script with Required Gems
To run a Ruby script that depends on specific gems, use the ruby command followed by -r or --require to specify the required gems:

```shell
ruby -r gem_name my_script.rb
```

#### 4. Uninstalling Gems
To uninstall a gem, use the gem uninstall command:

```shell
gem uninstall gem_name
```

#### 5. Updating Gems
You can update a gem to its latest version with:

```shell
gem update gem_name
```

##### 6. Creating Gemfiles
A Gemfile is used to specify project dependencies. To create one, simply create a file named Gemfile in your project's directory.

Gemfile Syntax
Here's a basic example of a Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile

# Specify a gem and its version
gem 'rails', '6.1.0'

# Specify multiple gems
gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4'
gem 'puma', '~> 3.12'
gem 'sass-rails', '>= 6'

# Groups for different environments (e.g., development, test, production)
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 5.0'
  gem 'pry'
end

group :production do
  gem 'pg', '>= 1.2', '< 2.0'
end
```

In the Gemfile:

Use the gem keyword followed by the gem name and its version or version constraints.
You can group gems using group to specify dependencies for different environments (e.g., development, test, production).
`~>` specifies a version constraint, allowing versions up to the specified version.
`>=` and `<` are used to specify version ranges.
After creating or editing the Gemfile, you need to run bundle install to install the specified gems.

### Running Bundler
To install all the gems listed in the Gemfile and create a Gemfile.lock file, run:

```shell
bundle install
```
This ensures that all project collaborators use the same gem versions.

Ruby's CLI, along with Gemfiles and the Bundler tool, are essential for managing dependencies and running Ruby scripts and applications effectively.
