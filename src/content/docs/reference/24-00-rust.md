Introduction to Rust Programming Language
Rust is a modern, systems programming language that focuses on safety, concurrency, and performance. Developed by Mozilla, Rust is designed to be a low-level language like C or C++ but with memory safety guarantees and modern language features. In this section, we'll cover the basics of Rust's syntax to get you started.

## Hello, World!
Let's start with a classic "Hello, World!" program in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Here's what's happening in this code:

**`fn main() { ... }`:** This is the entry point of the program. All Rust programs start execution from the main function.

**`println!("Hello, World!");`:** This line prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output. The println! macro is used for formatted printing.

Rust uses a unique syntax, and you'll notice some differences compared to other languages.

## Variables and Data Types
In Rust, you must declare a variable's type explicitly, or the compiler will infer it for you. Here are some common data types:

**Integer types:** i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, and isize/usize for machine-specific sizes.

**Floating-point types:** f32 and f64.

**Booleans:** bool.

**Characters:** char.

**Tuples:** Ordered, fixed-size collections of values with different types.

**Arrays:** Fixed-size arrays with elements of the same type.

**Slices:** Dynamically-sized views into a contiguous sequence.

**Strings:** UTF-8 encoded text.

## Variable Declaration and Assignment
Here's how you declare and assign variables in Rust:

```rust
let name: &str = "Alice"; // Immutable variable
let mut age: u32 = 30;    // Mutable variable
let: Keyword used for variable binding.
```

**`name: &str`:** Variable name and type annotation.

**`= "Alice"`:** Initialization.

**`mut`:** Keyword for mutable variables.

## Functions
Defining functions in Rust is straightforward:

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let sum = add(5, 3);
    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
}
```

**`fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { ... }`:** Defines a function named add that takes two i32 parameters and returns an i32 value.

**`-> i32`:** Specifies the return type.

## Control Flow
Rust offers common control flow constructs like if, else, loop, while, and for. Here's an example of an if statement:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 42;

    if number < 0 {
        println!("Negative");
    } else if number == 0 {
        println!("Zero");
    } else {
        println!("Positive");
    }
}
```

## Ownership and Borrowing
One of Rust's unique features is its ownership system, which ensures memory safety without a garbage collector. Rust uses ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes to manage memory efficiently.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // Moves ownership from s1 to s2
    // println!("{}", s1); // This line would cause a compilation error

    let s3 = s2.clone(); // Creates a deep copy
    println!("s2: {}, s3: {}", s2, s3);
}
```

**Ownership:** Each value in Rust has a variable that is its "owner."

**Borrowing:** Multiple references ("borrowings") to a value can exist, but only one can be mutable at a time.

**Lifetimes:** These annotations ensure references are valid.

## Rust CLI

The Rust CLI (Command-Line Interface) is an essential tool for working with Rust programming language. In this overview, we'll cover some of the most common Rust CLI commands for running single Rust files, creating Cargo projects, installing dependencies, running Cargo projects, and compiling Cargo projects.

### Running Single Rust Files
To run a single Rust file, follow these steps:

Create a new Rust file, e.g., my_program.rs.

Open your terminal.

Use the rustc command followed by the filename to compile and run the Rust program:

```shell
rustc my_program.rs
./my_program
```

This will compile the my_program.rs file and produce an executable named my_program. You can run it with ./my_program.

### Creating Cargo Projects
Cargo is Rust's official package manager and build tool. It simplifies project management and dependency handling. To create a new Cargo project, use the following command:

```shell
cargo new my_project
```

This command creates a new directory called my_project containing the necessary project files and directory structure. You can replace my_project with your desired project name.

### Installing Dependencies
To add dependencies to your Cargo project, you'll typically edit the Cargo.toml file and specify the dependencies there. For example, to add the popular rand crate as a dependency, open the Cargo.toml file and add the following:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"
```

After adding dependencies, run the following command to download and install them:

```shell
cargo build
```

Cargo will fetch and build all the specified dependencies and place them in the project's target directory.

### Running Cargo Projects
To run a Cargo project, use the following command from your project's root directory (where the Cargo.toml file is located):

```shell
cargo run
```

This command will build and execute your Rust project. If your project contains multiple binaries, you can specify which one to run using the -p flag followed by the target name defined in the Cargo.toml file.

### Compiling Cargo Projects
If you want to build your Cargo project without running it immediately, you can use the following command:

```shell
cargo build
```

This command compiles your project's source code and produces executable files in the target/debug directory. You can run the resulting executables directly from there.

For a release build with optimizations, use:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This creates optimized binaries in the target/release directory.

These are some of the fundamental Rust CLI commands you'll use when working with Rust projects. The Rust CLI, combined with Cargo, provides a robust and efficient development environment for Rust programming.

## Rust Pattern Matching 

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Rust that allows you to destructure and match values against patterns to control the flow of your code. It's similar to switch or case statements in other programming languages but more flexible and expressive. Pattern matching is often used with enums, structs, tuples, and more. Let's explore pattern matching in Rust.

### Basic Syntax
In Rust, you can use the match keyword to perform pattern matching. The basic syntax of a match expression looks like this:

```rust
match value_to_match {
    pattern1 => {
        // Code to execute when pattern1 matches
    },
    pattern2 if condition => {
        // Code to execute when pattern2 matches and condition is true
    },
    _ => {
        // Code to execute for any other case
    }
}
```

- **value_to_match:** The value you want to match against patterns.
- **pattern1, pattern2:** Patterns to compare against value_to_match.
- **condition:** An optional condition that can be added to patterns.

### Enum Matching
One common use of pattern matching is with enums. Enums are often used to represent different states or options, and pattern matching allows you to handle each case differently.

```rust
enum TrafficLight {
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}

fn main() {
    let light = TrafficLight::Red;

    match light {
        TrafficLight::Red => println!("Stop!"),
        TrafficLight::Yellow => println!("Slow down!"),
        TrafficLight::Green => println!("Go!"),
    }
}
```

### Destructuring Tuples and Structs
You can destructure tuples and structs in pattern matching to access their elements or fields.

```rust
fn main() {
    let point = (3, 4);

    match point {
        (0, 0) => println!("Origin"),
        (x, 0) => println!("On x-axis at {}", x),
        (0, y) => println!("On y-axis at {}", y),
        (x, y) => println!("At ({}, {})", x, y),
    }
}
```

### Pattern Matching with Guards
You can add guards to patterns to further refine when a pattern should match.

```rust
fn main() {
    let value = 42;

    match value {
        x if x < 0 => println!("Negative"),
        x if x > 0 && x <= 100 => println!("Positive and within range"),
        _ => println!("Other"),
    }
}
```

### Matching Option and Result
Pattern matching is often used to handle Option and Result types, which represent the presence or absence of a value and the success or failure of an operation.

```rust
fn main() {
    let maybe_value: Option<i32> = Some(42);

    match maybe_value {
        Some(value) => println!("Found value: {}", value),
        None => println!("No value"),
    }

    let result: Result<i32, &str> = Ok(42);

    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Success: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
}
```

### Advanced Pattern Matching
Rust's pattern matching can handle more complex scenarios, including nested patterns, ranges, and more. It's a versatile tool for writing expressive and safe code.

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    for number in numbers {
        match number {
            1..=3 => println!("Small number: {}", number),
            4 | 5 => println!("Large number: {}", number),
            _ => println!("Other: {}", number),
        }
    }
}
```

Pattern matching is a fundamental feature of Rust that helps you write concise, readable, and safe code. It's especially useful when dealing with complex data structures and error handling.

## Option, Future & Result

In Rust, working with Option, Future, and Result types is essential for handling potentially missing values, asynchronous computations, and error-prone operations. These types are fundamental for writing safe and robust Rust code.

### Option<T>
The Option<T> type represents either a value of type T (wrapped in Some) or the absence of a value (represented by None). It is commonly used for cases where a function might not always return a valid result.

Creating and Using Option

```rust
fn divide(a: f64, b: f64) -> Option<f64> {
    if b == 0.0 {
        None
    } else {
        Some(a / b)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let result = divide(10.0, 2.0);

    match result {
        Some(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        None => println!("Cannot divide by zero"),
    }
}
```

### Result<T, E>
The Result<T, E> type represents either a success value of type T (wrapped in Ok) or an error value of type E (wrapped in Err). It is commonly used for functions that may fail and need to provide an error explanation.

Creating and Using Result
```rust
fn divide(a: f64, b: f64) -> Result<f64, &'static str> {
    if b == 0.0 {
        Err("Division by zero")
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let result = divide(10.0, 0.0);

    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
}
```

### Future<T>
The Future<T> type represents a value that may become available asynchronously in the future. It's used extensively in asynchronous programming to perform non-blocking operations.

Creating and Using Future
```rust
use futures::Future;

fn main() {
    let future = async_function();

    tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()
        .unwrap()
        .block_on(async {
            let result = future.await;
            match result {
                Ok(value) => println!("Async result: {}", value),
                Err(error) => println!("Async error: {}", error),
            }
        });
}

async fn async_function() -> Result<i32, &'static str> {
    // Simulate an async operation
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(2)).await;
    Ok(42)
}
```

In this example, we use the futures crate and the Tokio runtime to work with async functions and await their results.

### Combining Option, Result, and Future
It's common to combine these types to handle complex scenarios in Rust programs. For example, you might have an async function that returns a Result<Option<T>>:

```rust
use std::io;

async fn read_file() -> Result<Option<String>, io::Error> {
    // Async file reading logic
    Ok(Some("File content".to_string()))
}
```
In such cases, you can use nested match statements to handle each layer of the type:

```rust
fn main() {
    tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()
        .unwrap()
        .block_on(async {
            let result = read_file().await;
            match result {
                Ok(Some(content)) => println!("File content: {}", content),
                Ok(None) => println!("File not found"),
                Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
            }
        });
}
```
Working with Option, Result, and Future is crucial for writing robust and error-handling code in Rust, especially in scenarios involving asynchronous programming and dealing with potential errors and missing values.


## Structs and Traits

### Structs
A struct in Rust is used to create custom data types that can hold multiple values with different data types. You can think of a struct as a blueprint for creating objects that share common attributes.

Here's a basic example of defining a struct and creating instances of it:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
    let point = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("Origin: ({}, {})", origin.x, origin.y);
    println!("Point: ({}, {})", point.x, point.y);
}
```

In this example, we define a Point struct with two integer fields, x and y. We then create instances of the struct and access their fields using dot notation.

### Traits
A trait in Rust is similar to an interface in other programming languages. It defines a set of methods that can be implemented by types (structs or enums) to provide specific behavior. Traits allow for code reuse and defining generic functionality.

Here's an example of defining a trait and implementing it for a struct:

```rust
trait Drawable {
    fn draw(&self);
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Drawable for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a circle with radius {}", self.radius);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle { radius: 5.0 };
    circle.draw();
}
```

In this example, we define a Drawable trait with a draw method. We then implement the Drawable trait for the Circle struct, providing a specific implementation for the draw method.

### Implementing Methods on Structs
You can implement methods directly on structs without using traits. These are called "associated methods" because they are associated with the struct itself, rather than an instance of the struct.

Here's an example of implementing methods on a struct:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn is_square(&self) -> bool {
        self.width == self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 5, height: 10 };
    let rect2 = Rectangle { width: 7, height: 7 };

    println!("Rectangle 1: Area={}, Is square={}", rect1.area(), rect1.is_square());
    println!("Rectangle 2: Area={}, Is square={}", rect2.area(), rect2.is_square());
}
```

In this example, we define the Rectangle struct and implement two methods, area and is_square, directly on the struct itself. We can then call these methods on instances of the struct.

### Implementing Traits for Structs
You can also implement traits for structs to provide behavior defined by the trait. This is useful for defining shared functionality across multiple types.

Here's an example of implementing a trait for a struct:

```rust
trait Printable {
    fn print(&self);
}

struct Book {
    title: String,
    author: String,
}

impl Printable for Book {
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("Book: {} by {}", self.title, self.author);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let book = Book {
        title: "The Rust Programming Language".to_string(),
        author: "Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols".to_string(),
    };

    book.print();
}
```

In this example, we define a Printable trait with a print method and implement it for the Book struct. We can then call the print method on a Book instance.

Structs and traits are powerful tools in Rust for creating custom data types and defining behavior for those types. They enable you to write clean, reusable, and organized code.
